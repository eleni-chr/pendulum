# pendulum
The function calculates the period T of a simple pendulum, which is the time required for a weight attached to a rod of length L and negligible weight to start from rest, swing with no friction under the influence of gravity from an initial angle a0, to â€“a0 and back to a0 again, as shown in the attached figure. The motion is determined by physics.
